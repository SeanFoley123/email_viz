#Visualizing the lives of Olin's email lists
##Dependencies and running the code
If you want to play with the Javascript, the repo is self-contained at the moment; all you need is an internet connection to reach the CDN for D3. 

##Giving credit
The D3 was heavily inspired by Michele Weigle's [scatterplot example](http://bl.ocks.org/weiglemc/6185069). 

The scraping done to get this data was informed by Ryan Mitchell's book [Web Scraping with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034391.do)

And of course, I owe it all to stackoverflow. Thank you wonderful question-answering people.
